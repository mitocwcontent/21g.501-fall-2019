Course Objectives and Procedures
--------------------------------

This course is designed for students with no previous knowledge of the language, providing opportunities to acquire basic skills for conversation, reading, and writing in Japanese. The program emphasizes active command of Japanese, not passive knowledge. Your goal is not simply to study the grammar and vocabulary, but to gain skills necessary to use them in a linguistically and culturally appropriate way.

In this course, there are two types of class sessions: grammar and drills. In grammar sessions, information necessary for using the language, such as grammar and socio-cultural information, will be provided primarily in English. Drill Sessions are conducted almost entirely in Japanese, concentrating on speaking activities that require you to use the language actively.

This course covers the first six lessons of the _Genki I_ textbook. By the end of the semester, you will be able to:

1.  read and write hiragana, katakana, and 58 kanji characters;
2.  talk about yourself/family/others, things, time, events, and activities—in the present, future, and past tense;
3.  shop at stores and order food at restaurants;
4.  make requests and ask for permission;
5.  talk about Dos and Don’ts; and
6.  ask for and give directions.

9.  _Attendance Policy_
    1.  Attend all sessions. Because of the cumulative nature of language learning, it is essential that you attend all sessions and keep up with the course work on a daily basis. Please follow the online daily schedule and come to class well-prepared.
    2.  If you have an unavoidable reason for your absence, please email the instructors before class.
    3.  _Be punctual_. Coming in late not only results in missed performances and quizzes that may not be made up for, but also distracts other students. Showing up late may affect your daily grade negatively.
    4.  _Use of laptops/tablets_ is strictly prohibited in class, except for note-taking during the grammar session.
10.  _Exams and Quizzes_

There are two oral interview tests, five lesson quizzes (20–25 minutes long), and a one-hour exam. Vocabulary, Hiragana, Katakana, and Kanji quizzes are given throughout the semester.

12.  _Homework Policy_

Submit all assignments at the beginning of the class. _Late submission will result in a 5% deduction in grade each day_. No credit will be given after three days. Any assignment you submit must be _your own work_.
